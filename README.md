# TOP-sub-strings

Made for the Ruby course of The Odin Project

Function substrings takes a word as the first argument and an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. 
It returns a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.
